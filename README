So, you want to develop gutenbach, eh?  Good!

Gutenbach is a distributed music player built on top of CUPs.  It
essentially enables anybody with access to it to play music from their
own computer -- all they have to do is "print" to the Gutenbach
instance as they would any other document!

The current Gutenbach features are:
    - the Gutenbach server (packaged as gutenbach-server)
    - a terminal queue display (packaged as gutenbach-queue)
    - remctl bindings (packaged as gutenbach-remctl)
    - client-side scripts to print to, list, and delete from 
      queues (packaged as gutenbach-client)
    - a Rhythmbox plugin
    - iTunes plugins
    - a webapp interface

All of these are located on GitHub:

In terms of how the repository is structured: after discussing the
possibility of supporting multiple systems, we decided it would be
best to merge everything platform unspecific into the master branch,
and then keep separate branches for each other system; e.g. at the
moment we have the debian branch, which should be the same as the
master branch except that it also contains a debian/ directory.  Now,
this means that you should never edit platform-unspecific files in the
debian directory; they should *always* be edited from the master
branch.  The debian branch should never be merged into the master
branch; merging should *always* happen the other way around.

See README.old for how Gutenbach /used/ to be installed.  This can
sometimes offer insight into how to fix things that are broken.

NOTES:

- If you keep getting zephyrs with the following errors:

      Playback completed with the following errors:
      bt_audio_service_open: connect() failed: Connection refused (111)
      bt_audio_service_open: connect() failed: Connection refused (111)
      bt_audio_service_open: connect() failed: Connection refused (111)

  This is because you have alsa configured for bluetooth, but
  bluetooth is not enabled.  You should either enable bluetooth, or
  uninstall the bluez-alsa package.

- The commands to print and remove jobs should be used via the scripts
  in gutenbach-client package.  However, if you insist on using them,
  the correct syntax is:
      
      CUPS_SERVER=servername lp -dqueuename foo.mp3
      CUPS_SERVER=servername cancel [ID|-a] queuename
