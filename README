So, you want to develop gutenbach, eh?  Good!

Gutenbach is a distributed music player built on top of CUPs.  It
essentially enables anybody with access to it to play music from their
own computer -- all they have to do is "print" to the Gutenbach
instance as they would any other document!

The current repositories for various Gutenbach features are:
    - gutenbach
    - gutenbach-queue
    - gutenbach-remctl
    - gutenbach-rhythmbox-plugin
    - gutenbach-itunes-plugin
    - gutenbach-web

All of these are located on GitHub:
http://github.com/search?langOverride=&q=gutenbach&repo=&start_value=1&type=Repositories

Additionally, see README.old for how Gutenbach /used/ to be installed.
This can sometimes offer insight into how to fix things that are
broken.

Questions or comments should be directed at gutenbach@mit.edu

TODO:
- include mixer and channel in debconf, or even better, move it to
  gutenbach-remctl and implement debconf in that package
- the filter should die and send an error message if it can't find the
  config file, not use defaults
- this should really not conflict with pulse
- finish the move to CUPS!
    * the CUPS daemon processes do not inherit groups from the lp user (so, for example,
      even if we add 'lp' to 'audio', the process will not be running in group 'audio').
      For the time being, I've set the CUPS daemon to always run under group 'audio',
      but there should really be a better solution.
    * lprm does not remove jobs -- we should maybe leave a pid file and kill the mplayer
      process if someone kills the job
    * you can currently play files locally, but not remotely -- why?
