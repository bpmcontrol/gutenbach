So, you want to develop gutenbach, eh?  Good!

Gutenbach is a distributed music player built on top of CUPs.  It
essentially enables anybody with access to it to play music from their
own computer -- all they have to do is "print" to the Gutenbach
instance as they would any other document!

The current repositories for various Gutenbach features are:
    - gutenbach
    - gutenbach-queue
    - gutenbach-remctl
    - gutenbach-rhythmbox-plugin
    - gutenbach-itunes-plugin
    - gutenbach-web

All of these are located on GitHub:

TODO:
- include mixer and channel in debconf, or even better, move it to
   gutenbach-remctl and implement debconf in that package
- the filter should die and send an error message if it can't find the
   config file, not use defaults
- this should really not conflict with pulse
- finish the move to CUPS!

Additionally, see README.old for how Gutenbach /used/ to be installed.
This can sometimes offer insight into how to fix things that are
broken.
