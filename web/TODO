1) make this look pretty (CSS, better layout, etc.)
2) add AJAX to automatically refresh the website when the queue
   changes
3) add a volume slider (use remctl, see http://sipb.mit.edu/sipbmp3
4) package the script and the lighttpd config file, and have it
   automatically run
5) make the queue interactive:  ability to pause, reorder songs,
   remove songs, etc.
6) ability to upload/queue songs?  maybe only with certs -- need to
   figure out the best way to have an ACL -- probably bad to let
   anybody upload songs.  The same probably goes for deleting and
   reordering songs too, though.
