This directory contains data used by remctl's test suite.  To enable tests
that require GSS-API authentication and a working end-to-end Kerberos
environment, create the K5 keytab that will be used for both the server
and the client and put it in this directory as test.keytab.  Then, create
a file named test.principal and in it put the principal name corresponding
to the key in the keytab on a single line ending with a newline.

The presence of these two files will enable the tests that actually do
GSS-API authentication.

If you are building in a different directory tree than the source tree,
don't put the files in this directory.  Instead, after running configure,
you will have an empty tests/data directory in your build tree.  Put the
test.keytab and test.principal files in that directory instead.
