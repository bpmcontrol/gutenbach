.SH NAME
gbq \- displays a remote Gutenbach queue
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gbq 
[-q \fIQUEUE\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Uses the perl Net::CUPS library to access a remote queue and display
the current jobs, along with ID numbers, owners, and filenames.  The
Gutenbach queue must have previously been added with
\fBgutenbach-client-config\fR so that gbq knows which host to use.  If
no queue is specified, \fBgbq\fR will try to use the default queue, if
one is configured.
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-queue\fR
Specify a queue other than the default
.TP
