.SH NAME
gbq \- displays a remote Gutenbach queue
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gbq 
[-q \fIQUEUE\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Uses the perl Net::CUPS library to access a remote queue and display
the current jobs, along with ID numbers, owners, and filenames.  The
Gutenbach queue must have previously been added with
.B gutenbach-client-config
so that gbq knows which host to use.  If no queue is specified,
.B gbq
will try to use the default queue, if one is configured.
