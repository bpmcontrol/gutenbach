.TH gutenbach-client-config 1 "27 June 2010"
.SH NAME
gutenbach-client-config \- displays a remote Gutenbach queue
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gutenbach-client-config 
[-l|--list|-a|--add|-d|--delete] [\fIQUEUE\fR] [--host \fIHOST\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Provides options to add, remove, or list remote Gutenbach queues.  The
list of queues is stored in the
.B $HOME/.gutenbach
directory, with a separate file for each queue.  This means that it is
not necessary for the local representation of a remote queue to have
the same name as the remote queue: for example, there could be a file
in the config directory called "sipb", whose contents specify the
remote to be "sipbmp3".  Then, when using other commands such as 
.BR gbr ,
.BR gbq , 
or 
.BR gbrm ,
you would use "sipb" instead of "sipbmp3".
