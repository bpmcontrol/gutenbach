.SH NAME
gbrm \- removes jobs from a Gutenbach queue
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gbrm 
[-q \fIQUEUE\fR] [all|current|\fIID\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Removes a single job from a Gutenbach queue, given the job id, which
can be obtained with the 
.B gbq
command.  If 
.B all
is used in place of an id, then all jobs are removed from the queue.  If
.B current 
is used in place of an id, then the current (top) job is removed from
the queue.  If
.B last
is used in place of an id, then the last job is removed from the
queue.  The queue must have previously been added with
.B gutenbach-client-config
so that gbrm knows which host to use.  If no queue is specified,
.B gbr
will try to use the default queue, if one is configured.
