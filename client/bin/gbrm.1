.SH NAME
gbrm \- removes jobs from a Gutenbach queue
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gbrm 
[-q \fIQUEUE\fR] [all|current|\fIID\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Removes a single job from a Gutenbach queue, given the job id, which
can be obtained with the \fBgbq\fR command.  If no queue is specified
with the \fB\-q\fR option, then the default queue will be used (which
should be specified with \fBgutenbach-client-config\fR).  If \fBall\fR
is used in place of an id, then all jobs are removed from the queue.
If \fBcurrent\fR is used in place of an id, then the current (top) job
is removed from the queue.  If \fBlast\fR is used in place of an id,
then the last job is removed from the queue.  The queue must have
previously been added with gutenbach-client-config so that gbrm knows
which host to use.
