.TH gbr 1 "27 June 2010"
.SH NAME
gbr \- sends a file to a Gutenbach queue
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gbr 
[-q \fIQUEUE\fR] \fIFILES\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Prints files to a Gutenbach queue, given the queue name and the path
to the files.  gbr correctly handles pathname expansion, so (for
example), if you wish to play all .mp3 files in a directory, the
command `gbr $queue *.mp3` will send each .mp3 as a separate job.  The
path may also be a URL to a
.B YouTube 
video (e.g. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foo).  The Gutenbach queue
must have previously been added with
.B gutenbach-client-config
so that gbr knows which host to use.  If no queue is specified,
.B gbr
will try to use the default queue, if one is configured.
