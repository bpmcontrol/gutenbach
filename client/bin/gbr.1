.SH NAME
gbr \- sends a file to a Gutenbach queue
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gbr 
[options] [-q \fIQUEUE\fR] \fIFILES\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Prints files to a Gutenbach queue, given the queue name and the path
to the files.  If no queue is specified with the \fB\-q\fR option,
then the default queue will be used (which should be specified with
\fBgutenbach-client-config\fR).  gbr correctly handles pathname
expansion, so (for example), if you wish to play all .mp3 files in a
directory, the command `gbr $queue *.mp3` will send each .mp3 as a
separate job.  The path may also be a URL to a \fBYouTube\fR video
(e.g. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foo).  The Gutenbach queue must
have previously been added with gutenbach-client-config so that gbr
knows which host to use.  If no queue is specified, gbr will try to
use the default queue, if one is configured.
