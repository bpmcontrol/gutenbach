If you want to help make changes to gutenbach, do NOT make changes
locally!  They will most likely get overwritten by the next package
install.  Instead, you should check out the source and edit the
package itself:

/afs/sipb/project/sipbmp3/gutenbach.git

It may be useful to just edit things locally to make sure they work,
and then add the change into the package.

zsr (in SIPB) is set up to build packages, and already has a git clone
in /root/gutenbach.  You can edit the source there, build the package,
and then reinstall the package.

A good guide to get started with debian packaging is here:

jhamrick (Jessica Hamrick) is currently the active maintainer for
gutenbach, so if you're interested in contributing but don't know
quite where to start, you should talk to her.
